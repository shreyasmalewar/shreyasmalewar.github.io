I am a Master's student in Computer Science (Graduating May 2025) at <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a> and a Research Assistant at <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/uscradiomicslab/" target="_blank">Radiomics Lab<a>.

<!-- I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/vinay-anant-duddalwar/" target="_blank">Dr Vinay Duddalwar<a>  and <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Oberai/Assad" target="_blank"> Dr Assad Oberai<a>. -->

My research focuses on developing deep learning models to solve segmentation problems in computed tomography scans. I have a keen interest in foundation models for medical imaging, MRI reconstruction, connectomics and neuroimaging.

I believe that food is a way of life and love to indulge in various cuisines, this also makes me a dedicated fitness enthusiast to compensate for my love for food.

Reading about finance, science and technology is a "fun" thing I do in my free time.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
