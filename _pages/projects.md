- #### Exploring Complex Regularization techniques for Image Classification

  [Report](/assets/pdf/CSCI-567-Final-Report.pdf){:target="\_blank"}

  - Analyzed impact of dropout, data augmentation, ridge, and ensemble regularization of performance of convolutional neural network built to classify 15 classes from tiny ImageNet dataset.
  - Conceptualized Mobile Inverted Bottleneck layers and compound scaling of EfficientnetB0 and implemented various regularization techniques for ImageNet dataset.

- #### Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Romanized Text
  [Report](/assets/pdf/CSCI-544-Final-Report.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
  - Devised methods to finetune Meta’s Tiny-llama and Microsoft’s Phi-2 large language models (LLMs) using low rank adapters for sentiment analysis and machine translation for non-Latin languages Hindi and Korean
  - Established the positive impact of romanization, pretraining and continual finetuning on performance of LLMs
