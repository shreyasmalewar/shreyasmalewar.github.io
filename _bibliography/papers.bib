	abstract = {It is a herculean task to predict air quality of a particular area due to indefinite characteristics. As air pollution is a complex mixture of toxic air components that include ozone (O3), particulate matter 2.5{\_}m (PM2:5), SO2, RSPM, SPM and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). These small particles penetrate deep into the alveoli as far as the bronchioles, interfering with a gas exchange within the lungs. Though research is being conducted in environmental science to evaluate the severe impact of particulate matters on public health. The capital city of Maharashtra, Nagpur is used as a case study since nearly ten thousand motor vehicles are being registered in Nagpur on a monthly basis contributing exponentially to air pollution. Various machine Learning-based algorithms are checked to compare and to find out the predictive analysis using available dataset. After comparing seven different machine learning algorithms, Boosted Random Forest algorithm was found out to be the most accurate predictive algorithm, with the maximum coefficient of determination and less mean absolute error.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a clustering-based approach to identify and predict a suitable interest group for students in higher education system. Student interest group stands for on-campus students club that reflects the co-curricular or extra-curricular participation of students apart from general academics. Such interest groups play a vital role in development of a student’s overall personality. K-means clustering algorithm has been used for this purpose. The experiment has been carried out on data collected by surveying students in higher education space. The purpose of this survey is to capture interest features of the student which is fed to the clustering algorithm. The overall concept ensures streamlining of the student’s efforts to maximize success.},

abstract = {Introduction
Prostate adenocarcinoma frequently metastasizes to bone and is detected via computed tomography (CT) scans. Accurate detection and segmentation of these lesions are critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. This study aims to automate lesion detection and segmentation using deep learning models.
Methods and Materials
We evaluated deep learning models for lesion detection (EfficientNet, ResNet34, DenseNet) and segmentation (nnUNetv2, UNet, ResUNet, ResAttUNet). Performance metrics included F1 score, precision, recall, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Pairwise t-tests compared segmentation accuracy. Radiomic analyses compared lesions segmented by deep learning to manual segmentations.
Results
EfficientNet achieved the highest detection performance, with an F1 score of 0.82, precision of 0.88, recall of 0.79, and AUC of 0.71. Among segmentation models, nnUNetv2 performed best, achieving a DSC of 0.74, precision of 0.73, and recall of 0.83. Pairwise t-tests showed that nnUNetv2 outperformed other models in segmentation accuracy (p < 0.01). Clinically, nnUNetv2 also demonstrated superior specificity for lesion detection (0.90) compared to the other models. All models performed similarly in distinguishing diffuse and focal lesions, predicting weight-bearing lesions, and identifying lesion locations, although nnUNetv2 had higher specificity. Sensitivity was highest for rib lesions and lowest for spine lesions across all models.
Conclusions
EfficientNet and nnUNetv2 were the top-performing models for detection and segmentation, respectively. Radiomic features derived from deep learning-based segmentations were comparable to manual segmentations, supporting clinical applicability. Further analysis of lesion detection and spatial distribution underscores the models' potential for improving diagnostic workflows and patient outcomes.}
